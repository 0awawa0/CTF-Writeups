# Can You Read Me

## Problem

![task](./src/task.png)

## Solution

So we are given nothing but the server address. Let's try and connect to it

![cipher1](./src/cipher1.png)

My first thought was that this is some code. But then I thought about googling the pikachu language and here it is:

![pikachu](./src/pikachu_lang.png)

So this is a programm. After googling some interpreter I found this:
[pikachu-interpreter](https://github.com/joelsmithjohnson/pikachu-interpreter)

I installed it and executed the code:

![pickachu_run](./src/pikachu_run.png)

Sending this to ther server and here is a round 2:

![brainfuck](./src/brainfuck.png)

Well, that's easy one. Who doesn't know brainfuck? Executing it online:

![brainfuck_run](./src/brainfuck_run.png)

And moving on to the last round:

![last](./src/last.png)

Wow, that looks like some chaos. But, googling esotric programming languages gives us this:

![Malbolge](./src/Malbolge.png)

Well, this is something similar to our string. Googling Malbolge interpreter and finding this:
 [Malbolge](http://malbolge.doleczek.pl)

And executing gives us  flag:

![flag](./src/flag.png)
